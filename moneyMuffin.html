      <div class="moneyMuffin--67milestonePartners-description">By partnering with 67th Milestone, you develop a 
          strategy to promote your products and services to a large audience throughout the time until the 
          event is done. Your participation confirms to our members your ongoing commitment to best practices, 
          education, high-value products and technology, and improvement of the industry as a whole. 
          Most importantly, we get you in front of our audience â€” helping you make a strong statement with just 
          your presence and nurture relationships to ensure ongoing success. Since our in-house population and 
          subscribers are diverse in nature thereby focused in possibly related products and 
          services, your partnership of the 67th Milestone is not diluted as in other associations that 
          have a much broader focus.<br><br>
          Our philosophy of collaboration has always been about ensuring satisfaction to our providers. 
           We aim to establish 67th Milestone not only to be one of the most successful student organized
            fests, but also to be an influential platform for our partners to showcase themselves in the 
            finest way possible. Partnering with us is appealing to many because of the perceived status,
             undoubted tangible and intangible rewards, and endorsement to your support for emerging 
             flairs and experience in the profession. Also, as a partner, you not only influence how 
             well your organization is showcased, but also aid us in carrying out our completely 
             student run fest diligently.
