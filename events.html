              We will host upcoming engineers and developers from all over India
              to create mobile, web, and hardware hacks. <br />Last year,
              HackBMU 1.0 garnered huge attention with 20+ teams from around the
              country. Also, we aimed to close the gender gap in hackathon
              participation and encouraged female participants to join up by
              reserving seats. The response was overwhelming, and nearly half of
              our participants were women. <br />Riding on the success of last
              year’s event, we’d like to aim for even greater heights. The
              previous version of HackBMU was a 36-hour event. This time around,
              we are planning to extend the time period to 48 hours.
