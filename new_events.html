          The art and style of DJ’s began with the mixing of two
              identical records back and forth, extending the rhythmic
              instrumental segment. In the 80’s House music was born
              with the release of the very first house music album. Shortly
              thereafter, house music poured into the mainstream. The
              era of the 90’s created the rave scene with acid houses and
              the birth of digital music. This growing industry spawned
              on the birth of the DJ Superstars.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          For those inspired to become a future DJ, War of DJs is
          a competition where DJs come and compete to show
          off their talent and skills. Each of the participant DJ will
          be given a time slot of 20 minutes for their performance
          including setup time and they can play any genre of their
          own preference. It is mainly judged on their technical
          abilities to mix tracks, stage confidence and crowd
          control. The one with maximum total of points combined
          from all the judging criteria wins. Prizes will be awarded
