        <p>67th Milestone ‘19 is the third annual Techno-Cultural and Management fest of BMU.
          67th Milestone is a multi-faceted festival which will host a wide range of cultural and technical programs
          and this edition
          of the fest is to be hosted from from 8th-10th February 2019. Throughout the three days, it will offer a
          platform for artists
          to perform, techies to prove their brilliance, speed enthusiasts to get behind the wheel, and fashion freaks
          to walk the ramp.
          With the 67th Milestone only a few months away, every corner of the campus on eavesdropping has some gossip
          about 67th Milestone to offer.
          Observing the success of previous editions of the ‘67th Milestone’, with a huge participation from various
          colleges and universities,
          the 67th Milestone ‘19 will strive to surpass the expectations and hopes of the participants and will set new
          benchmarks for the Annual fests in India.
          67th Milestone uniquely distinguishes itself to their partners by offering companies an opportunity to hold
          recruitment rounds for students.
          Students, as well as every other individual present for this promising event, will have the opportunity to
          witness performing arts at it’s best,
          technical geniuses battling against each other for the throne, and to gain inspiration from and interact with
          eminent leaders of the industry,
          executives from leading business houses and achievers from their respective spheres. </p>
