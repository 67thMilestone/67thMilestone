            groups) together, to create living art-pieces across the
            campus.<br>

            lights, sounds, and everything that could possibly be used
            as a form of expression or embellishment.<br>

            have people create without expectations, fear, or purpose.

                <div class="description">The art and style of DJ’s began with the mixing of two
      identical records back and forth, extending the rhythmic
      instrumental segment. In the 80’s House music was born
      with the release of the very first house music album. Shortly
      thereafter, house music poured into the mainstream. The
      era of the 90’s created the rave scene with acid houses and
      the birth of digital music. This growing industry spawned
      on the birth of the DJ Superstars.<br>For those inspired to become a future DJ, War of DJs is
      a competition where DJs come and compete to show
      off their talent and skills. Each of the participant DJ will
      be given a time slot of 20 minutes for their performance
      including setup time and they can play any genre of their
      own preference. It is mainly judged on their technical
      abilities to mix tracks, stage confidence and crowd
      control. The one with maximum total of points combined
      from all the judging criteria wins. Prizes will be awarded
      to the 1st and 2nd Position worth INR 15K and INR 10K
      respectively. The first position will receive reward in kind
      from the sponsored company.
