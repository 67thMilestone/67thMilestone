          By partnering with 67th Milestone, you develop a strategy to promote your
          products and services to a large audience throughout the time until
          the event is done. Your participation confirms to our members your ongoing
          commitment to best practices, education, high-value products and
          technology, and improvement of the industry as a whole. Most importantly,
          we get you in front of our audience — helping you make a strong statement
          with just your presence and nurture relationships to ensure ongoing
          success. Since our in-house population and subscribers are diverse in
          nature thereby focused in possibly related products and services, your
          partnership of the 67th Milestone is not diluted as in other associations
          that have a much broader focus.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Our philosophy of collaboration has always been about ensuring
          satisfaction to our providers. We aim to establish 67th Milestone not
          only to be one of the most successful student organized fests, but also
          to be an influential platform for our partners to showcase themselves in
          the finest way possible. Partnering with us is appealing to many because
          of the perceived status, undoubted tangible and intangible rewards, and
          endorsement to your support for emerging flairs and experience in the
          profession. Also, as a partner, you not only influence how well your
          organization is showcased, but also aid us in carrying out our
          completely student run fest diligently.
