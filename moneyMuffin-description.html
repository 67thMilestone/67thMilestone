      Money-Muffin is an initiative to help the students and clubs raise funds
      for their projects, tours or excursions related to academia or any
      activity contributing to their personal growth and exposure. Such funds
      have, in the past, been raised as a grant by the University or by personal
      means. It started off in 2017, as a means to fund the Four Horsemen for
      their participation in The Hult Prize Singapore, and since then there has
      been no looking back. We have already had 2 editions of Money Muffin, with
      it getting bigger and better with each successive attempt.The nature of
      the event is such that it is customisable as per the needs of the
      organisers, with only requirement being that they stick to the crux, which
      is organising a “food centric fest”. <br /><br />
      The first edition , held on 13 and 14 Feb, 2018 witnessed a footfall of
      around 1200 , and ended up raising Rs. 75,000 for the organisers. There
      were about 10 stalls , with each stall making revenues above 30,000.
      <br /><br />

      For the second edition held on 24-25 October, 2018, which witnessed 12
      stalls, a footfall of 1500 students, food competitions and ended up
      raising a total amount of 1,00,000 rupees for the organisers, with each
      vendor making revenues of 50,000 or above. <br /><br />
      For the third edition of Money Muffin we estimate to bring in more than 15
      vendors, a footfall of more than 2500, coupled with the tunes of the
      ‘Local Train’. Not only is this event going to be centred around our
      university, but aims to target 20 or more colleges from all parts of the
      country.
